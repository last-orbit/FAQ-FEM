### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

- JS

### What I learned

Boy oh boy, This project is from a website called frontend mentor under the easy/beginner section and this one was certainly compared to the other easy/beginner but those only utilized 
HTML and CSS. So the fact that this was considered beginner certainly intimates me for their other projects. So in the end I had follow someone else's code in order to understand the process,
really greta that I will linke below. I learned how to really take notes before starting to code instead of just rushing into a project as it greatly effects the duration of the project. 
Along with that, learning how to reverse engineer code and utilizing the internet in order to find a solution.
